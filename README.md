# Introduction
Lung cancer is caused by an error of the DNA in cells of the lungs, which can develop into a tumor and destroy systems in the body.
To predict the potential for lung cancer, the data provide conditions that cause this disease, such as smoking, which is a well-known condition, and others.
The code analyses the data to graph, so it makes it easier to see if any condition affects a lot and causes lung cancer.
